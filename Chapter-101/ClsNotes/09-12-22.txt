OBSERVATIONS 
===================

### COMPILING & RUNNING
	javac fileName.java
	java clasName

1. When class is public , fileName must be same as className.
2. When Class is not public.
	- compile with fileName
	- run with className
	- by default it will generate byte with className.
	
3. order of public static can be of different ways 
		public static 
		static public
		
		String[] args
		String []args
		String args[]
4. You can compile java program , without main method , but we can't run it.
5. Possible to have mutliple class's in one file , ---> creates mutliple .class files.
		- when ever you have multiple .class files while running , execute with individual names.
			java A
			java B
